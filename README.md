# KAS-pipe
KAS-pipe is an analysis pipeline for KAS-seq data. KAS-seq is a kethoxal-assisted single-stranded DNA sequencing (KAS-seq) approach, based on the fast and specific reaction between N3-kethoxal and guanines in ssDNA. KAS-seq allows rapid (within 5 min), sensitive and genome-wide capture and mapping of ssDNA produced by transcriptionally active RNA polymerases or other processes in situ using as few as 1,000 cells. KAS-seq can also enable definition of a group of enhancers that are single-stranded and enrich unique sequence motifs. Overall, KAS-seq facilitates fast and accurate analysis of transcription dynamics and enhancer activities simultaneously in both low-input and high-throughput manner. KAS-pipe as a analysis pipeline for KAS-seq data, which provides many shell scripts for KAS-seq data processing, for example, reference genome index setup, adapter sequence trimming, alignment, differential analysis and so on.
